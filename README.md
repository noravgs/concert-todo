## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js and MongoDB.

In this project, I used node.js and EJS to access and render HTML. I used MongoDB to store documents of tasks that the user want to complete. This app focuses on tasks that people might need to do before attending to a concert.   

## Lessons Learned:

While working with EJS, I learned how easy is to format JS with HTML since the syntax is similar. I keep learning different ways to connect to a MongoDB database and use .env to keep my access-key secret.
