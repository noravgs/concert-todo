## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Cocktail rest API

This was a project were I had to used specific API data to render the information that I wanted to display to the user. I used filter and map JavaScript's methods in order to facilitate access to the API. 

## Lessons Learned:

While working with the Cocktail rest API. I learned how to acces data with different JS methods that I was not familiar with. I also learned how to create a simple CSS card to display the cocktail information.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
